#WHAlertView: Have your alerts and eat them too.

##What is it
Alert views that can have their own custom animations and skinned UI.

##Why I made it
Because I wanted cool alert views like TweetBot.  I wanted to be able to have custom animations for presenting and dismissing alerts, as well as be able to customize the UI. **This is really rough code that still needs a lot of work.  I wanted to get it out so people could get their hands on it to spark their imaginations on how alerts can be done differently on iOS.**

##How to use it
WHAlertView has three different ways to instantiate an alert:

###An API similar to UIAlertView:
    - (id)initWithTitle:(NSString *)title 
                message:(NSString *)message
               delegate:(id<WHAlertViewDelegate>)delegate
      cancelButtonTitle:(NSString *)cancelButtonTitle 
      otherButtonTitles:(NSString *)otherButtonTitles, ... NS_REQUIRES_NIL_TERMINATION;

Or:

###An API similar to [UIAlertView+Blocks](https://github.com/jivadevoe/UIAlertView-Blocks)*:
    - (id)initWithTitle:(NSString *)title
                message:(NSString *)message
       cancelButtonItem:(WHAlertButtonItem *)cancelButtonItem 
       otherButtonItems:(WHAlertButtonItem *)otherButtonItems, ... NS_REQUIRES_NIL_TERMINATION;

Or:

      - (id)initWithTitle:(NSString *)title
                  message:(NSString *)message
         cancelButtonItem:(WHAlertButtonItem *)cancelButtonItem
    otherButtonItemsArray:(NSArray *)otherButtonItems;

I'm pretty partial to block-based APIs:

    WHAlertButtonItem *cancel = [WHAlertButtonItem alertButtonItemWithTitle:@"Cancel"];
    WHAlertButtonItem *ok = [WHAlertButtonItem alertButtonItemWithTitle:@"OK"
                                                                 action:^{
                                                                     NSLog(@"Pressed OK!");
                                                                 }];

    WHAlertView *alert = [[WHAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@"Hello!"
                                                    message:@"This is an alert"
                                           cancelButtonItem:cancel
                                           otherButtonItems:ok, nil];
    [alert show];

It's that easy!

###But how do I customize the animations or UI?
In addition to a delegate protocol, `WHAlertView` defines two other protocols that your custom classes need to implement: `WHAlertViewAnimator` and `WHAlertViewCustomizer`.  You can assign an instance of `WHAlertView` with implementors of those protocols, ***or*** use the following API to register a class that implements those protocols:

    [WHAlertView registerAnimationClassForAlertAnimations:[WHTweetBotAlertViewAnimator class]];

Or:

    [WHAlertView registerCustomizerClassForAlertUI:[WHFlatCustomizer class]];

Registering a class saves you the trouble of having to instantiate and assign instances of those classes every time you need to pop up an alert: Your *custom* alerts should be *consistent* throughout your app.  The override is in place for instances where you may have a special kind of animation or custom alert that only needs to be shown in certain situations:

    WHAlertView *alert = [[WHAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@"Hello!"
                                                    message:@"This is an alert"
                                           cancelButtonItem:cancel
                                           otherButtonItems:ok, nil];
    alert.animator = [[WHPinWheelAlertViewAnimator alloc] init]
    [alert show];

Here's an example implementation of an animator:

    #import "WHDropAlertViewAnimator.h"

    @interface WHDropAlertViewAnimator()

    @property (nonatomic, assign) CGPoint originalCenter;

    @end

    @implementation WHDropAlertViewAnimator

    - (void (^)(void))showAnimationForAlertView:(WHAlertView *)alertView {
        CGPoint center = alertView.center;
        alertView.center = CGPointMake(alertView.center.x, -alertView.window.bounds.size.height);
        self.originalCenter = center;
        alertView.alpha = 0.0f;

        return ^ {
            alertView.center = CGPointMake(center.x, center.y + 25.0f);
            alertView.alpha = 1.0f;
        };
    }

    - (void (^)(BOOL finished))showCompletionForAlertView:(WHAlertView *)alertView {
        return ^(BOOL finished){
            [UIView animateWithDuration:0.2
                             animations:^{
                                 alertView.center = self.originalCenter;
                             }];
        };
    }

    - (void (^)(void))dismissAnimationForAlertView:(WHAlertView *)alertView {
        return ^{
            alertView.center = CGPointMake(alertView.center.x, alertView.bounds.size.height + alertView.window.bounds.size.height);
        };
    }

    @end


#Known Issues:

- The `layoutSubviews` needs a little bit of cleanup
- Accessory view is not yet implemented (but will be implemented when `layoutSubviews` is fixed.
- Window rotation code needs some improvement
